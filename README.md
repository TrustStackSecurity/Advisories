# Advisories

At TrustStack Security, we are always looking for interesting vulnerabilities in the wild—whether during client engagements, red team ops, or our own research. We will update this page based on those findings.

When appropriate, we’ll also include a technical breakdown or proof-of-concept to highlight the risk and educate others on how the vulnerability works in practice.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

We believe in responsible disclosure that gives vendors time to fix issues before public release. Here's how we handle it:

* We’ll try all available channels to get in touch with affected vendors—whether that’s through email, a contact form, or even social media.

* All relevant technical details will be provided to help the vendor reproduce and fix the issue quickly.

* We keep findings confidential during the disclosure window (typically 90 days), unless otherwise agreed upon.

* If a CVE is appropriate and the vendor isn’t a MITRE CNA, we’ll work with a CNA partner or request issuance directly from MITRE.

* Once the disclosure period ends, we’ll publish an advisory on our site and/or social channels with relevant technical details and PoCs.

* If we don’t hear back from the vendor within 30 days, we reserve the right to disclose the issue in the interest of public safety.



## Disclosure Scope
We publish all findings related to third-party software uncovered during client work or independent research—especially in cases where no vendor CNA exists to manage the vulnerability.
